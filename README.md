- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ Algorithms  
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor 
- KNN Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

## 🧪 Dataset
- Preprocessed with feature selection and scaling

## 📈 Results
- Achieved over **99% accuracy** in predictions
- Evaluated using MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² score

## 💡 Key Features
